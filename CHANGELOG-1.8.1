Changelog for LetoDMS version 1.8.1 - (C)2010 Matteo Lucarelli
================================================================================

REDESIGNED THE ORGANIZATION OF DATA  FOLDER ===============================

Now the data folder (where files are located) has a more efficient organization:

data_dir / id / version.filetype

This scheme makes backups much more intuitive (the folder name has
corresponding to the id of the document, all versions and attached files
are in the same folder.

- Removed no longer needed tdbDirPath and tdlPathList
- Removed no longer needed free path lookup functions 
- Modified sql create_tables.sql for changes to the DB in accordance with the new organization

WARNING: This change makes the version incompatible with existing archives/DB
but is required by the all thennew features (read ahead)

The "UPDATE" folder contais two script for updating existing installations

To update an existing archive:
- Backup all (including DB)
- Install the new DMS version
- Install the "UPDATE" folder containing two files update.php and update.sql
- Log in as administrator
- Manually invoke the script (http://indirizzo/UPDATE/update.php
- Remove the folder "UPDATE"

If everything works well the old content has ben renamed "old" and can be removed (eg via ftp)

ADDITION FILES ================================================================

Added the ability to upload additional files associated to a document (as attachments)
these files are not versioned and are designed as accessories to the document
(Eg the PDF version or reductions in the image). The files are associated with 
the document, not to version.

NOTE: To add attachments the user must have write permission on the document
The attachment can be removed by the user who added it or having total permissions

BACKUP ================================================= ========================

Added some useful tools for backing up files and folders (real files, not the DB).
Especially useful for working with entire folders which, being virtual,
can not easily be backupped via ftp.

There are three operations designed to be eventually applied in sequence.

Data Backup versioning:
Create for each document in a DMS folder a file containing the main versioning informations
This allows you to make backup copies of which also contain information from the DB. 
This is meant to be performed before the creation of an archive, 
After creating the file versioning file can be viewed from out.ViewDocument

Creating Archives:
Creates a tar.gz file containing all files related to a specific
DMS folder. The file is created in settings->_contentDir
The file is constructed so that it can be unpacked again in the settings->_contentDir
to restore removed files. In the page is presented the list of  existing backup files
which you can downloaded or delete

Deleting files:
you can delete from the server all the files related to a specific
DMS folder and all its subfolders. By doing this you can
free space on the server without removing the version information
saved in the database that will be available for regular consultation.
Having a backup deleted files can easily be restored when needed.

All backups operations can be performed on the entire archive or only on a DMS folder.
All backups operations are accessible only to administrators.

OTHER FEATURES ================================================ ==========

Added the possibility to change a approval/review already done.
The editing is possible at any moment only to the user who made it. 
The time is retained (so you can understand subsequent amendments). 
The document status is updated automatically following a change. 
The editing is only possible on the latest version of the document.
If a document expire date is set editing is only possible within that time

Added delete_all_contents script. Cleaning DB tool for test use

Proper content of some e-mail

Added general information to the statistic page:
- No. of documents
- No. of folders
- No. of files in every document
- Number of total files
- Total size of the archive

Fixed the view of system notify list

The comments related to the update opration (versione comment) are now editable 

Adjusted out.DefaultKeywords now equal to out.UserDefaultKeyword

Added function formatted_size (view size in Bytes / Kb / Mb / Gb) in inc.Utils and applied where necessary

Fixed a bug on documents cancellation (was not removed the corresponding list of notification)

The files in data folder can be removed without cause errors in the DMS. 
When a file is not effectively present in out.ViewDocument displays a warning "file removed"
and, of course, is no longer given the option to download.
This feature can be used to free up space on the server, removing old files, while leaving available the corresponding
version information.

Fixed the view in out.AddSubFolder.php (default font size)

Added icons for openoffice.org mime-type 
Added icons for some types of extensions (bz, dot, docx, etc.).
