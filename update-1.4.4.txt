              MyDMS 1.4.4 Update from previous Version
-------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Requirements

You must have an older version of MyDMS installed and configured
correctly on your system.


2. Updating the Database

An update with the included SQL-script is only possible from version
1.3.1 (if you still use an even older version of MyDMS you can obtain
the appropriate SQL-file from the demo-system on http://dms.markuswestphal.de/demo).
Run update_tables-1.5.0.sql.


3. Updating the PHP-files

You can just overwrite the existing files with the new ones.
But be careful with inc.Settings.php: When overwriting this file all your
personal settings such as DB-Server are lost. You should therefore make
a backup of that file so that you can easily restore your settings.

That's all you have to do.


3. Install additional languages and themes

Since version 1.3.1 you have to install additional languages (only
german and English are included) manually. You can download language
files from dms.markuswestpahl.de/download.html. Unzip the downloaded
file in the langauges-dicrectory.
The same applies to themes (you have to unzip the downloaded files to
the themes-directory, of course).


5. Additional Mime-types

Each Mime-Type is represented by an icon. You can add additional Mime-Types
by placing an image-file in out/images/icons an adding an entry to the $icons
array at the end of file inc/inc.OutUitls.php (only for users with PHP experience).
Attention: Changes to inc.OutUtils.php are also lost when updating. So don't
forget to make a backup.



6. Auto-conversion to HTML

Version 1.3.0 introduced a new feature: Documents can automatically be
converted to HTML when uploading.
You can enable this feature by setting $_enableConverting (in 
inc.Settings.php) to true.
You will also need to edit $_convertFileTypes (again in 
inc.Settings.php). This array defines which file-types are converted
and how they are converted.
Under Windows Word-, Excel- and Powerpoint-Files are automatically
converted using js-Scipts and MS-Office. I tested it with Office 2000
and it worked just fine.
Under Linux mswordview is used to convert Word-Files by default.
Warning: Getting this feature working can be very tricky but if it
works it is a great enhancement I think.
Especially IIS could cause problems with its IIS-Guest-Account not
having enough rights to execute Word or Excel...
You will also have to edit your httpd.conf to be able to view the converted
files online. Load mod_rewrite and add to following lines to your conf:

  RewriteEngine on
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} (.*)viewonline/([0-9]+)/([0-9]+)/(.+)$
  RewriteRule (.*)viewonline/([0-9]+)/([0-9]+)/(.+)$ $1op.ViewOnline.php?request=$2:$3 [PT]

IIS Users can download the IIS Rewrite Engine for example:

Post any questions about auto-conversion to the MyDMS forum, please.
