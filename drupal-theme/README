              LetoDMS Installation Instructions
-------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT TRANSLATIONS ============================================== 

as you can see letoDMS provide a lot of languages but we are not professional 
translators then we wait for users contributions.

If your language is not present in the login panel:
- copy the language/english/ folder and rename it as you language
- open the file languages/your_lang/lang.inc and translate it
- open the help file languages/your_lang/help.htm and translate it

If you see some wrong or not translated messages:
- open the file languages/your_lang/lang.inc
- search the wrong messages and translate them

if you have some "error getting text":
- search the string in the english file (languages/english/lang.inc)
- copy to your language file (languages/your_lang/lang.inc)
- Translate it

If there is no help in your language:
- Copy the English help (english/help.htm) file to your language folder
- Translate it!

If you apply any changes to the language files please send them to letoDMS 
developers (www.letodms.com).


0. Quick installation instructions =============================================

You need a working web server with MySQL/PHP support.

* Unpack all the files in a public web server folder. If you're working on a 
host machine your provider will indicate you where you should upload the files.

* if you have PHP4 download older version ADODB (http://adodb.sourceforge.net/) 
and replace the adodb folder in the letoDMS directory. The included adodb works 
with PHP5 then nothing to do here if you have a PHP5 installation

* Create a data folder somewhere in your web server. The data folder created by
the letoDMS archive should work for a test installation and must be set as 
writable to the web-server user.

For security reason the data folder should not be inside the public folders.
The directory must have read/write permission for the web-server user.

* Create a new DB on your web server
* Create a new user for the DB with all permissions on the new DB
* Execute "create_tables.sql" in the new DB

* Edit the inc/inc.Settings.php to match your preference and settings. 
At least $_rootDir, $_httpRoot, $_contentDir, $_ADOdbPath, $_dbHostname, 
$_dbDatabase, $_dbUser, $_dbPass must be edit. Note that for the path you 
probably need to ask to your provider because the absolute path on the server
is not immediatly viewable in a hosted system.


NOTE: UPDATING FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION

- make a backup archive of your installation folder
- make a backup archive of your data folder
- dump your current DB
- extract the letoDMS archive to your web server
- edit the inc/inc.Settings.php file to match your previuos settings 
  (you can even replace the file with your own one eventualy adding by hand
  the missing new parameters)
- login as administrator
 -execute all the update.php script pointing your browser directly:
  http://www.yoursite/path/to/dms/UPDATE-vX.X.X/update.php

Every script is require to update starting from a version previous than the
one in the folder name. For example to update from a 1.7.1 to 1.9 you need
to run both UPDATE-v1.8.1/update.php and UPDATE-v1.9/update.php.


1. Requirements ================================================================


MyDMS is a web-based application written in PHP. It uses the MySQL RDBMS to
manage the documents that are loaded into the application.

Make sure you have PHP 4.0 or higher installed, and MySQL 4 or higher. MyDMS
will work with PHP running in CGI-mode as well as running as module under
apache. If you want to give your users the opportunity of uploading passport
photos you have to enable the gd-library (but the rest of MyDMS will
work without gd, too).

You will also need to download and install the ADODB database
abstraction library from http://adodb.sf.net/ since MyDMS relies
upon it for all database connectivity.


2. Installation & Configuration ================================================

Unzip the downloaded archive in a directory that is accessible via your web server.

You will also need to create a directory where the uploaded files
are stored. This directory should not be accessible via your
web-server for security reasons (create it outside of your www-root
directory or put an appropriate .htaccess file in it).

Download the ADODB package from SourceForge. The URL for the ADODB project
page is:

        http://adodb.sourceforge.net/

Extract the distribution into a suitable directory. For example, one can
extract the files into the MyDMS root directory.

Next you should set up your Database. Use the included script
create_tables.sql. Since the exact procedure differs on the
different database-systems I cannot give you a detailed instruction
here. Post any questions concering this problem to the MyDMS-Forum. In
general, create the database, make sure that the database has been selected
(e.g. "USE mydms;"), then run the script. As of 1.6.0, you must make sure
that the database user has "create temporary table" privileges.

N.B. If the create_tables.sql script fails, it may be because the database
has been configured to use InnoDB tables by default instead of MyISAM tables.
If this is the case, it will be necessary to alter the sript such that each
create table command has the text " ENGINE = MyISAM" appended to the end,
immediately prior to the semi-colon. For example:

  Before:

  CREATE TABLE `tblDocumentLocks` (
    `document` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
    `userID` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
    PRIMARY KEY  (`document`)
  ) ;

  After:

  CREATE TABLE `tblDocumentLocks` (
    `document` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
    `userID` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
    PRIMARY KEY  (`document`)
  ) ENGINE = MyISAM ;

Now edit the configuration file. First, go to the "inc" directory and copy
(or move) "inc.Settings-sample.php" to "inc.Settings.php". Open the file and
set the variables to the correct values (you will find a short description
for each variable in the file itself).

TIP: You can find out your root-directory by placing the following
line into a php-file: <?php phpInfo(); ?>
Open it with your browser and look for "DOCUMENT_ROOT".

When running into problems with the db-settings, read the readme-file
in the adodb-directory or post questions to the MyDMS-Forum.

By default PHP allows only files to be uploaded that are up to 2Mb
in size. You can change this limit by editing php.ini: Search for
"upload_max_filesize" and set it to the appropriate value (you
should also change the value for "post_max_size" and make sure that
your web-server does not limit the size either).


3. Email Notification ==========================================================

A new, re-vamped Notification system allows users to receive an email when a
document or folder is changed. This is a new, event-based mechanism that
notifies the user as soon as the change has been made and replaces the
cron mechanism originally developed. Any user that has read access to a
document or folder can subscribe to be notified of changes. Users that
have been assigned as reviewers or approvers for a document are
automatically added to the notification system for that document.

A new page has been created for users to assist with the management of
their notification subscriptions. This can be found in the "My Account"
section under "Notification List".


4. Auto-conversion to HTML =====================================================

Version 1.3.0 introduces a new feature: Documents can automatically be
converted to HTML when uploading.
You can enable this feature by setting $_enableConverting (in 
inc.Settings.php) to true.
You will also need to edit $_convertFileTypes (again in 
inc.Settings.php). This array defines which file-types are converted
and how.
Under windows Word-, Excel- and Powerpoint-Files are automatically
converted using js-Scipts and MS-Office. I tested it with Office 2000
and it worked just fine.
Under Linux mswordview is used to convert Word-Files by default.
Warning: Getting this feature working can be very tricky but if it
works it is a great enhancement I think.
Especially IIS could cause problems with its IIS-Guest-Account not
having enough rights to execute Word or Excel...
You will also have to edit your httpd.conf to be able to view the converted
files online. Load mod_rewrite and add to following lines to your conf:

  RewriteEngine on
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} (.*)viewonline/([0-9]+)/([0-9]+)/(.+)$
  RewriteRule (.*)viewonline/([0-9]+)/([0-9]+)/(.+)$ $1op.ViewOnline.php?request=$2:$3 [PT]

IIS Users can download the IIS Rewrite Engine for example:
http://www.qwerksoft.com/products/iisrewrite/

Post any questions to the MyDMS forum, please.


5. Nearly finished =============================================================

Now point your browser to http://your.server.com/mydms/index.php
and login with "admin" both as username and password.
After having logged in you should first choose "My Account" and
change the Administrator's password and email-address.
